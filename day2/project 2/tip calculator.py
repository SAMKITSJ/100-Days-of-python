# tip calculator which calculates the amount every person should after adding tip to the total bill 

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

total_bill = (float(bill)+(float(bill)*float(tip)/100))
persons = input("how many persons did you want to split the bill? ")
amount = total_bill/int(persons)
